Orphilia is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. Project's main goal is to provide an open-source desktop Dropbox client for platforms, that aren't supported (for example, Haiku). Orphilia is script-based which makes it platform-independent. It's written using Dropbox SDK from here, which has been integrated into Orphilia's source code and is not required for installation.
