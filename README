Orphilia is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. Project's main goal is to provide an open-source desktop Dropbox client for platforms, that aren't supported (for example, Haiku). Orphilia is script-based which makes it platform-independent. It's written using Dropbox SDK from here, which has been integrated into Orphilia's source code and is not required for installation.

[!] IMPORTANT [!]
	Even though most of the work is currently done on Windows, it's not a target platform. If you still want to try it there, USE THE FORCE (--force parameter).

[!] IMPORTANT [!]
	Orphilia doesn't have production status yet, so you'll need your own API keys (from here - https://www.dropbox.com/developers) in order to test it.
