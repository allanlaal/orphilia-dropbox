Orphilia is an open-source Dropbox client written in Python. Project's main goal is to provide an open-source desktop Dropbox client for platforms, that aren't supported (for example, Haiku). Orphilia is script-based which makes it platform-independent. It's written using Dropbox SDK from here, which has been integrated into Orphilia's source code and is not required for installation.

[!] IMPORTANT [!]
	Windows port is in very early stage of development and it doesn't even build. As there is no need for an open-source Dropbox client for Windows, I don't care about making it usable at the moment. Source code contains some workarounds for NT to make it work and it was almost complete a long time ago. If you're intrested in updating Windows port (build scripts, workarounds etc.), just contact me.

[!] IMPORTANT [!]
	Orphilia doesn't have production status yet, so you'll need your own API keys (from here - https://www.dropbox.com/developers) in order to test it.

Installing dependencies (Linux/FreeBSD/Windows):
---
	Go to dependencies directory and run "python setup.py install" from command prompt/BASH shell.


Building:
---
Haiku/Linux/FreeBSD:
	python build.py

Windows: 
	python build.py --force


Installing
---
Haiku:
	To install, double-click on haiku_install.sh

Linux/FreeBSD (CLI):
	Make sure that Python and required modules are installed, then type: orphilia --install

Windows (I don't think you'll even build it anyway):
	The same as with Linux (no GUI yet on those two platforms)
